## Basic Statistics
```{r}
##a.Sibling survey
sbl = c(2,3,0,5,2,1,1,0,3,3)

summary(sbl)

##Mode Calculation

names(sort(-table(sbl)))[1]

##Variance
var(sbl)
##Standard deviation
sd(sbl)

##b.Ageing Survey

age = c(23, 25, 18, 45, 30, 21, 22, 19, 29, 35)

##i. Covariance between siblings and ages
cov(sbl, age)

## Correlation between siblings and ages
cor(sbl, age)

##Positive or negative correlation between siblings and student ages
plot(sbl, age, xlab="Nro of Siblings", ylab="Age")

##There is strong positive correlation betwen siblings and student age

##Even there is a strong correlation, the data isn't justifying the relationship between numbers os sblings
#and the age of the student

```

'we see that the rows are neighbourhoods of the Boston area wich are the elements and the
columns are 14 predictor variables, including:
crim: per capita crime rate by town
zn: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft
indus: proportion of non-retail business acres per town
chas: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
nox: nitrogen oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
rm: average number of rooms per dwelling
age: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
dis: weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centres
rad: index of accessibility to radial highways
tax: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
ptratio: pupil-teacher ratio by town
black: 1000(Bk - 0.63)Ë†2, where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
lstat: lower status of the population (percent)
medv: median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s'

'We might found that some of the predictors are related, such as:
medv-rm (Positive)
medv-lstat (Negative)
lstat-rm(Negative)
dis-nox(Negative)
age-nox(positive)'

#c. Any predictors associate with per crime rate

crim_cor <- function(predictor, predictor2 = Boston$crim) {return(cor(predictor, Boston$crim))}
print(sort(sapply(Boston, crim_cor)))

'rad-crim --> strong positive correlation. It seems that the high access to motorway increase the crime rates.
tax-crim -> strong positive correlation
black-crim -> strong negative correlation
medv-crim -> strong negative correlation'

#d. Any surburbs to have particularly high crime rate?
'With boxplot to examine the rates'

boxplot(Boston[c("crim")], horizontal=TRUE, par(pin=c(4,1)), xlab="Per capita crime rate")

boxplot(Boston[c("tax")], horizontal=TRUE,xlab="full-value property-tax rate per $10,000")

boxplot(Boston[c("ptratio")], horizontal=TRUE,xlab="pupil-teacher ratio by town")

t(sapply(Boston[c("crim", "tax", "ptratio")], range))

'Crime rate -> high numbers where the wider number os surburs have 30 % of crime rate. But also some neighbours rose to 88 % for crime rate per capita.
Besides, the tax value for proteties has a max of 711 but the mean is around 300.
The pupils per class the max is 22'

#e.Number of Neighbours bound river

#f. Median pupil

#g. lowest media occupied-home
which.min(Boston$medv)

t(Boston[which.min(Boston$medv), ])

t(sapply(Boston, range))

'Comparing the values for neighbourhood 399 with the ranges across the whole data set, we see the following
predictors as standing out: zn (low), indus (high), age (high), dis (low), rad (high), tax (high), ptratio
(high), black (high), and medv (low).
The values suggest that this is an, old, highly industrial, low-income, inner-city neighbourhood,'
